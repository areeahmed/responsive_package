# responsive_package

## Why this project has been created?

this project has been created for learning responsive flutter package.

## What happened?

This package is responsive but, not usable for every platforms, for example if you add a drawer to your project and run your project on desktop the design will be not beautiful I can say will not be good design according to UX Standards.

## So What?

My Suggestion is: use this package while your application is for specific platforms like Mobile and Tablet, not for multiple platforms like Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop, this Will not be a beautiful design according UX Standards.
